## Description
This project is the first to analyze and study the mechanistic characteristics of CAV swarms at the road network level, and we introduce a new performance metric: the macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD).

##  Innovation
This project proposes the mechanistic characteristics of AV swarms: the microscopic self-organized driving behaviors of AVs lead to significant performance differences in the macroscopic system level, with the right-of-way conflicts playing a dominant role.

## Highlights
+ This project investigates the key ways for automated vehicles (AVs) to improve the traffic efficiency of two-dimensional urban network traffic.
+ Different cooperative driving strategies are investigated in a systematic and comprehensive way, and we find that the passing order has a dominant impact on the network traffic efficiency.
+ This project compares the differences and characteristics of the impact of the passing orders and the car-following gaps on the urban network traffic.
+ By using the macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) as the performance metric, we find that a better passing order can broaden the free flow region and improve the maximum flow, which is of great benefit to the network traffic efficiency.
