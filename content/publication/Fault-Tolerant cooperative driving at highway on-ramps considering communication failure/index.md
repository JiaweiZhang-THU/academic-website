abstract: Cooperative driving has great potential to improve traffic safety and efficiency and has been widely discussed in recent years. However, most existing researches only focus on the ideal communication environment and ignore the potential vehicle communication failure, which poses serious safety threats to traffic safety. To fill this research gap, we propose three designing principles for a fault-tolerant cooperative driving model considering communication failure. We let vehicles make real-time decision adjustments according to changes in communication conditions. Fault and non-fault vehicles can execute different decision models in a distributed manner. We test with on-ramps scenarios in simulations. Experiment results demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed model in achieving fault tolerance while reducing the impacts on traffic efficiency.
